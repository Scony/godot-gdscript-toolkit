# Changelog

## master

### Added
 - Added support for `export onready var` statement on `class` level
 - Added support for `mastersync` and `puppetsync` functions
 - Added support for standalone comments in expressions (except for few corner-cases)
 - Added `--diff` option to `gdformat` which acts the same as `--check`, but with additional difference printing
 - Added support for single line pattern formatting (forced for now)
 - Added `--fast` option to `gdformat` to skip safety checks (thus being faster)

### Fixed
 - Fixed exception handling in `gdparse`, `gdlint`, and `gdformat`
 - Fixed adding newlines around non-standard functions like `static func`, `master func` etc.

### Changed
 - Changed formatter to keep going despite failures

## [3.3.0] 2021-08-31

### Added
 - Added support for `pass` statement on `class` level
 - Added a possibility to disable linter checks in range from e.g. `# gdlint: disable=function-name` to `# gdlint: enable=function-name`
 - Added support for `puppet var`
 - Added string formatting according to `GDScript style guide` (`'x'` -> `"x"`, `'"'` -> `'"'`. `"'"` -> `"'"`, `'"\''` -> `"\"'"`)
 - Added linter option `tab-characters` that allows treating tabs as multiple characters while calculating line length

### Fixed
 - Fixed comment persistence check
 - Improved comments handling
 - Improved utf-8 support
 - Fixed type cast (e.g. `1 as String`) to always be in one line (this is forced by Godot's bug)

### Changed
 - Removed support for legacy (godot `3.1`) parenthesesless `assert` (e.g. `assert 1 == 1`) due to grammar conflict with modern (godot `3.2` assert)
 - exclamation-mark-based not-test expression will be now formatted without space (`!(1==1)` instead of `! (1==1)`) while for `not` the behaviour remains the same (`not (1==1)`)
 - Removed whitespace from `export (...)` - will be formatted as `export(...)` from now on

## [3.2.8] 2020-09-15

### Added
 - Added support for legacy (godot `3.1`) parenthesesless `assert` (e.g. `assert 1 == 1`)
 - Added support for recursive file finding in `gdlint` (e.g. `gdlint dir1/ dir2/`)
 - Added pre-commit hooks which can consumed by `pre-commit` project
 - Added a possibility to ignore linter checks inplace (e.g. `# gdlint: ignore=function-name` inline or in the line before)
 - Added support for underscored numeric literals such as `1_000_000`, `1_000.000`, and `0xff_99_00`

### Fixed
 - Introduced WA for Godot's `preload` bug
 - Improved formatter to remove trailing whitespaces also from comments
 - Added missing `class_name (...) extends (...)` statement support in grammar and formatter
 - Fixed false positive `TreeInvariantViolation` for `neg_expr`

### Changed
 - `var x = load('some.tres')` is allowed since it may be custom resource instance loading

## [3.2.7] 2020-05-08

### Fixed
 - Added missing expression operators (`^=`, `>>=`, and `<<=`)

## [3.2.6] 2020-04-05

### Fixed
 - Improved comment parsing time by a tiny chunk
 - Improved formatting time due to loosen grammar removal
 - Improved formatting time due to grammar caching
 - Improved formatting time due to parse tree reuse in safety checks
